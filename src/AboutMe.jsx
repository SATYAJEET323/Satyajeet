        Hello! I'm a passionate developer deeply fascinated by the endless possibilities of the coding world. From building
        interactive web apps to solving complex algorithms, I love exploring new technologies and creating meaningful
        projects. 
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        My journey began with curiosity about how websites and apps work behind the scenes. Since then, I've been hooked
        on learning programming languages, frameworks, and tools that help bring ideas to life.

        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring open-source projects, participating in coding challenges, or
        brainstorming innovative ideas to make life simpler and more exciting with technology. My ultimate dream is to
        leave an impact in the coding world by creating solutions that inspire and help others.
